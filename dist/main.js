A patient in London has been in remission for 18 months after treatment involving stem-cell transplants. The cells were taken from donors who have rare genetic mutations that make them resistant to HIV. This case comes more than 10 years after a Berlin patient was similarly cured by stem-cell therapy.\",\r\n    \"The Fortnite World Cup has wrapped up its first-ever massive sporting event, in New York.

Musk is cofounder of Neuralink, a start-up which aims to implant a device in the brain that would communicate with an iPhone app and computers as well. Musk says the device could be used to improve memory, repair motor function or just help people with cognitive defects. He says the trials could begin by the end of next year. Critics, though, are warning about the risks of business enterprises gaining access to brain data.\",\r\n    \"A Muslim supermodel is making history with her appearance in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition.
